- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

1. build usermode first ( then open the usermode exe and copy the offsets displayed on the console )
2. then after you have gotten the offsets from the application, open the injector KERNEL source and replace the offsets with the new offsets that you got with the usermode application
3. After you have REPLACED the offsets with the NEW ones you can map the driver. | but make sure the usermode exe is closed when you map the driver or it will result in bluescreen
4. After you have mapped the driver launch the game that you are wanting to inject into. after the game has fully launched then open the USERMODE APPLICATION | once the usermode is open click onto your games window and it should inject.



5. MAKE SURE YOU FOLLOW THE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS BECAUSE THIS IS THE CLEAREST YOU WILL GET.
